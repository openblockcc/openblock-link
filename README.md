Scratch Arduino Link is a helper application that lets you connect Scratch to Arduino Robots and Arduino Boards.

Using Scratch Arduino Link requires both [Scratch Arduino](https://scratch.ottawastem.com) and a compatible Arduino Robot or Arduino device.

Scratch Arduino Link appears as an icon at the bottom of your screen.

[Scratch Arduino](https://scratch.ottawastem.com) is fork of [official Scratch 3.0](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui), 

# Using Scratch Arduino Link with Scratch 3.0
